# Basic Shell

This directory contains a basic shell program. Currently, it is able to take
one command with one argument from a user, fork a child process and run the
program specified. It also redirects the output of the program to a text file,
shell-output.txt.

Code based on p3-exec and p4-redirect programs provided by the instructor.

Further edits as warranted - more details soon.

# Basic Shell

This directory contains a basic shell program. It takes commands from the
user, forks a child process, and runs the program specified.

It redirects the output of the program to a text file, shell-output.txt. The
shell terminates if the user enters the string "exit" at the prompt.

## Refrences

This assignment was prepared in a manner consistent with the instructor's
requirements. All significant collaboration or guidance from external sources
is clearly documented. These include:

* p3-exec and p4-redirect; the shell seen here was built based on the
  structure of these programs, including the directory search and
  redirection of the output to a specific file.
  

Further edits as warranted - more details soon.
